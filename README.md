# Project Counter Overflow

Silly willy spamming for silly willy people from [okayxairen Community](https://discord.com/invite/cTyWY42Ycb)

[WHATHOW Website](https://whathow.neocities.org/) is the website and the counter is in it.

The goal in life is a very simple one, its not about money.. men.. or anything in between!

Its to make this counter above go to 999,999,999 and see what happens.. maybe we get choco and who doesn't like choco!

## Installation + Running
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/astoko/CounterProject.git
$ cd CounterProject
$ ulimit -n 8192
$ python main.py
```

ulimit -n will need to be above ~7000 for this to work.
It uses ~20gb of ram, but each individual process is only about 25mb.

## Dependencies
 - Python
 - Colorama

No, the owner of the site has said that it is okay.\
